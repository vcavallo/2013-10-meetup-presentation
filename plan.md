# What is this talk for?
Anyone can build a gem! â€¦is what this presentation would be called if I was teaching you how to build a gem. But that is relatively straightforward and there are tons of tutorials which can leave you with a finished gem in about 10 minutes or less. *Because* gem-building is so accessible, I'm interested in what separates a 'pro' gem from an 'amateur' gem - and I don't mean in the functionality of what the gem does. I'm talking the meta-layer of everything else *but* the gem's functionality.  

###Things like:

- documentation
- tests
- proper license
- environment-awareness
- versioning
- clarity about Ruby version support
- general responsibility to the public

# Main points

- Proper documentation
- Importance of testing re: gems
- License and contributions
- Semantic version
- Travis
- Respect to the global load path
	- directory structure
